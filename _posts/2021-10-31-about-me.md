Hi! I'm a software/devops engineer currently working at <a href="https://getpenta.com/en">Penta</a>.<br>
<br>

A couple of years ago, I was mostly working with Javascript. As I started investing effort to learn how to actually run the applications I write, I was faced with a whole new world of exciting stuff I knew almost nothing about. A couple of Dockerfiles and k8s manifests later, I started working full time in an infrastructure team.<br>
<br>

Nowdays I'm trying to expand both my infrastructure and development skills with the aim to get better at writing infrastructure tooling, as I feel this beautifully blends the two loves I have.<br>
