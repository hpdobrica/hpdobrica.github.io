    <h1>Welcome to my Digital Garden</h1>
    
    <p>
        Hello there, my name is Dobrica and I'm a backend-developer-gone-devops from Serbia. 
        This is my digital garden, which is a fancy way of saying "a place where I put notes about the things I learn".
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Go to <a href="../notes"> notes </a> to check out what i've been working on. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        If you are interested in how the setup of this digital garden looks like, check <a href="../notes/My-Digital-Garden-setup">this note</a> out.
